# KBDL Traceability Matrix

Lifecycle status of this framework: `Approved`. Rows below reflect only
KBDL-001 scope.

Return to the [specification index](README.md). Status labels are defined in
[conventions.md](conventions.md#1-status-labels).

## Purpose

This matrix connects each approved blueprint concept or KBDL-001 requirement
to its roadmap origin, its requirement ID (where assigned), its location in
the specification, its approval and validation status, and how it was or
will be validated. It is updated whenever a requirement is created, changes
status, or is validated.

Each row is presented as a list of fields rather than a single wide table
row, so it remains readable without horizontal scrolling.

## Fields

Every row records:

- **Blueprint section** — The approved KBDL blueprint concept this row traces to.
- **Roadmap prompt** — The roadmap step (e.g. KBDL-001) that owns this row.
- **Requirement ID** — The requirement ID, if one has been assigned yet.
- **Specification location** — The file (and heading, where applicable) this concept lives in.
- **Approval status** — The lifecycle/approval label from [conventions.md §1.1](conventions.md#11-lifecycle--approval-status). Only `Approved` authorizes implementation.
- **Validation status** — The validation label from [conventions.md §1.3](conventions.md#13-validation-status): `Verified` or `Not verified`. Independent of approval status; `Verified` never implies `Approved`, and `Approved` never implies `Verified`.
- **Validation method** — How this requirement is or will be checked (for example manual review, link check, Markdown lint).
- **Validation evidence** — A concrete pointer to the evidence (a commit SHA, a named review, a tool's output), or `Not verified` if no validation has actually been performed yet. Evidence must never be the traceability matrix pointing at itself.
- **Known limitation** — Any known gap or caveat, or `None identified`.
- **Related decision** — Decision ID from the [decision register](decision-register.md), if applicable.
- **Notes** — Free text.

## Notes on Scope

No requirement in this matrix outside `GOV` has been implemented, designed,
or validated. Rows for later roadmap modules exist only to show where their
future requirements will be traced once their roadmap step is reached.
Approval status and validation status are recorded independently for every
row; a row being `Approved` never implies it is `Verified`, and a row being
`Verified` never implies or grants `Approved` status.
